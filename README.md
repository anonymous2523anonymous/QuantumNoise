# Quantum Noise Analysis

This repository contains three folders related to quantum algorithm analysis and noise studies.

## Folder Structure

- **NAPR/**  
  Contains code to compute the **NAPR metric** for three quantum algorithms: **VQC**, **QAOA**, and **VQE**.

- **noise_benefits/**  
  Contains code to verify the **benefits of noise** for various noise channels.

- **real_machine/**  
  Contains code that was executed on **real quantum machines** to evaluate the **overhead of noise mitigation techniques**.

## Steps to Run

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. **Navigate to a folder**
   ```bash
   cd NAPR
   or (or noise_benefits, real_machine)

3. **Run the desired script**
 ```bash
   python file_name.py

 Replace file_name.py with the actual filename in the folder.
